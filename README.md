# getting-cleaning-data_Final-proyect

In this repo you will find the script that help us to clean and reshape the data.

This can be touhght like a summary of the steps to get the tidy data:

1. Download the data
2. See what files are inside
3. Pass to R the differents sets found
4. Get only the columns releated with the mean and standar deviation (in the x_train, and x_test tables) 
5. Get the names of that columns in the last step
6. Select the columns and search the data frame with the names of the activity (y_train,y_test)
7. Merge the final tables
8. Create a new data set that compute the average for every subject (there are 30) and every activity (there are six) that he realized in the differents measures
